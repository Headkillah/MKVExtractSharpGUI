# MKVExtractSharpGUI
This is an GUI application written in C#


Since the update v20.0.0 ('I Am The Sun') of MKVToolNix, the old MKVExtractGUI2 is no longer working;

so I wrote this application, to make things easy again.

===

Advantages (compared to MKVExtractGUI2):

the entire window accepts file drag & drop (file path will be written into the "input" TextBox).

other than .mkv and .mka, OpenFileDialog allows .mks and .mk3d files.

===

Disvantages (for now):

probably not all the output file extensions are covered.

a track selection function is not designed, all the tracks will be equally extracted.
